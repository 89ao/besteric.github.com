**关于交换链接**（直接复制[Fenng](http://dbanotes.net/)同学的）

我一般不交换链接。

In general I don't do link exchanges.

我发现的网站和文章，如果我想链接我会主动链接。

I find sites and articles I want to link to on my own.

我不介意有人询问，但不要期待我的回答。

I don't mind people asking, but don't expect a reply.

如果你有个blog希望我能了解，酷，但我会先去看看再决定是否链接。别为此骚扰我。

If you have a blog you want me to know about, cool, but I want to read it for awhile before I decide to link to it. Don't bug me about it.
