time goes， you say?  
  
no, time stays,we go  
  
All you’ve got to do is decide to go and the hardest part is over. So go!   
  
I love three things; the sun, the moon and you 。 the sun for the day 。 the moon for the night 。　and you for ever  
  
theres a danger in loving somebody too much  
  
Time heals everything,that’s only outsiders say.  
  
love is too short，forgetting is too long  
  
There is no remedy for love but to love more  
  
For you a thousand times over  
  
double is trouble, single is simple
